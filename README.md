# Vala Snippets

Vala Snippets is meant to be an extension to help with Vala Object Oriented Programming. 

It is still in infancy stages. I personally do not know the full extent of valadoc for Vala but we can build it together. Kindly submit a PR.

## Features

Building resourceful snippets from valadoc as I learn it.

## Requirements

You just need VS Code to add the extension.

## How to contribute

Lots of snippets are missing. Please make some PRs
* `snippets` - is the folder containing all snippets files. 
* Any new file created must be added to `package.json` in `root`.

## Known Issues

Lots of snippets missing.

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0
